# scope-rs - Implementation Plan

An oscilloscope audio visualizer inspired by sosci. Displays audio input as real-time XY oscilloscope graphics.

## Current Status

**Completed through Milestones 10, 11 & 12** - The app has:
- Audio input capture with cpal (reactive gain control)
- Device selection dropdown
- XY oscilloscope display with persistence/afterglow
- Multiple display modes (Dots, Lines, Gradient, Points)
- Channel controls (swap X/Y, invert, DC offset)
- Color themes (Green, Amber, Blue, White, Purple, Cyan, Red)
- Audio file playback with symphonia (WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, etc.)
- Audio output during file playback (via cpal output stream)
- Waveform overview with seek bar
- Playback controls (play/pause/stop, loop, volume, speed)
- Settings panel with all controls
- Lock-free audio (SPSC ring buffers)
- Modular code structure (audio/, render/)
- Zero compiler warnings

## Dependencies (Current)

```toml
[dependencies]
eframe = "0.29"
cpal = "0.15"
symphonia = { version = "0.5", features = ["all"] }
rfd = "0.15"
thiserror = "2.0"
ringbuf = "0.4"
log = "0.4"
env_logger = "0.11"
```

## Dependencies (Planned)

```toml
# Milestone 14+
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
midir = "0.10"
```

---

## Running

```bash
cargo run
```

Select an input device, click "Capture" to visualize audio as XY oscilloscope graphics.

## Testing with osci-rs

You can route osci-rs output to scope-rs:
1. Run osci-rs and click Play (generates circle)
2. Use a virtual audio cable or loopback to route output to input
3. Run scope-rs and select the loopback device
4. You should see the circle generated by osci-rs

## Context for AI Assistants

This project is part of a Rust learning journey. The user is a beginner learning Rust by building practical applications.

The code prioritizes clarity and educational value over maximum performance. For example, we use `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for thread communication (simple to understand) rather than lock-free structures (which come in Milestone 12).

When continuing development:
1. Check current milestone status above
2. Review existing code structure
3. Follow the pattern of existing modules
4. Explain Rust concepts as they appear
